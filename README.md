## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Robust Encryption:** Encrypt files and folders locally with industry-standard cryptography before storage.  
- **Seamless Sync:** Secure synchronization of encrypted data across devices and cloud platforms.  
- **Granular Access Control:** Fine-grained permissions and sharing options with audit logging.  
- **User-Friendly UI:** Easy drag-and-drop file management with clear encryption status indicators.  
- **Backup & Recovery:** Encrypted backups with secure recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss.  
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Desktop and mobile clients with consistent encrypted storage experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Electron for desktop; React Native for mobile apps  
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with key derivation (PBKDF2/Scrypt)  
- **Backend:** Node.js microservices for metadata, sync orchestration  
- **Storage:** Cloud object storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage) for ciphertext  
- **Key Management:** Client-side key generation and management, no plaintext stored server-side
